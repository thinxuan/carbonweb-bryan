# Version Comparison: Render vs GCP

## üé® Key Differences Observed

### Render Version (https://carbonwallet.onrender.com/)
- **Branding:** Shows "Carbon AI" 
- **Color Scheme:** Different colors (based on screenshots)
- **Logo:** Different logo/design
- **Structure:** Different layout and content organization

### Current GCP Version (Your Deployed Code)
- **Branding:** "CarbonWallet" 
- **Color Scheme:** Green theme (#1AB3C5, #2bd7bd gradients)
- **Logo:** CarbonWallet branding
- **Structure:** AI for Net Zero messaging with green balls/graphic elements

## üîç What's Happening

Based on the code structure, your application should be displaying:
- "AI for Net Zero" headline
- "CarbonWallet" branding
- Green color scheme
- Value propositions: Validate, Enrich, Connect
- Industry cards (Hospitality, Finance, Supply Chain, Corporate)
- "Others measure. We validate." section
- Logo slider
- Insights section

## üí° Possible Reasons for Differences

1. **Different Code Branch:** Render might be deploying from a different branch
2. **Environment Variables:** Different APP_ENV or configuration
3. **Build Process:** Render might be using different build commands
4. **Custom Styling:** Frontend developer may have added custom CSS
5. **Static Assets:** Images/CSS might not be loading correctly

## ‚úÖ What to Check

### 1. Check Which Files Are Being Served
Visit: https://www.carbon2030.ai/ (production)
Or: https://carbonwallet-prod-486326684341.asia-southeast1.run.app

Compare the headers, colors, and branding.

### 2. Check Routes
Both should serve `home.blade.php` at the root `/` route

### 3. Check Environment Variables
```bash
# Production
echo $APP_URL
echo $APP_ENV
echo $APP_NAME
```

### 4. Check Static Assets
Verify images and CSS are loading:
- `public/css/style.css`
- `public/images/home/*`
- `public/images/logo.svg`

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Visit Your Production URL:** https://www.carbon2030.ai/
2. **Take screenshots** of what you see
3. **Compare** with what the frontend developer has on Render
4. **Decide** which version/style is correct
5. **Sync** the codebase to match your desired design

## üìù Current Expected Design

Based on your `home.blade.php` file, the production should show:

- **Header:** "AI for Net Zero"
- **Subheading:** "The audit-ready ESG and carbon accounting platform that validates Scope 1‚Äì3 data with AI precision."
- **Colors:** Green gradients (#1AB3C5, cyan tones)
- **Buttons:** "Start for Free" and "Request a Demo"
- **Value Props:** Validate, Enrich, Connect (expandable boxes)
- **Industry Cards:** 4 cards with images
- **Differentiation Section:** "Others measure. We validate."
- **Logos:** Sliding logo carousel
- **Insights:** 3 blog/insight cards

---

**Note:** The GCP deployment should match your codebase exactly. If the frontend developer has modifications on Render, you'll need to either:
1. Pull their changes into your repo
2. Or ensure they're deploying from the correct branch/repo
